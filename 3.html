    LANY was formed in March 2014 when Paul Jason Klein, who

    discontinued after the formation of LANY. The following month
    they anonymously uploaded two songs, "Hot Lights" and "Walk
    Away", to SoundCloud in order to differentiate between their
    old and new projects. Their debut EP, Acronyms, followed later

    Hollywood" and "Bad, Bad, Bad" soon followed, along with the
