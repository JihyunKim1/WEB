  <p>The 1975 are an English pop rock band from Manchester,
    consisting of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Matthew
    "Matty" Healy, lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross
    MacDonald, and drummer George Daniel.
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">
    The band's origins trace to their attendance at Wilmslow
    High School in Cheshire and playing together as teenagers
    in 2002. Gigs organised by a council worker led the band to
    formally sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. The band
    opened for several major acts and released a series of
    extended plays (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) throughout
    2012 before releasing their self-titled debut album (2013),
    which included the popular singles "Sex", "Chocolate", and
    "Robbers", reaching number one in the United Kingdom.
